`AiiDAlab <https://materialscloud.org/aiidalab>`_ applications typically involve some of following steps:

* Prepare the input for a calculation (e.g. an atomic structure).
* Select computational resources and submit a calculation to AiiDA.
* Monitor a running calculation.
* Find and analyze the results of a calculation.

The AiiDAlab widgets help with these common tasks.
