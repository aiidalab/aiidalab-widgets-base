AiiDAlab Widgets Base (AWB) is a library of widgets that is used in AiiDAlab when building applications.
The main goal of most of the widgets is to provide a user friendly interface to interact with `AiiDA <https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core>`_ objects.
Some other widgets are more of a general purpose with a goal to help you building powerful applications.
