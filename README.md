# AiiDAlab Widgets

[AiiDAlab](https://materialscloud.org/aiidalab) applications typically involve some of following steps:

 * Prepare the input for a calculation (e.g. an atomic structure).
 * Select computational resources and submit a calculation to AiiDA.
 * Monitor a running calculation.
 * Find and analyze the results of a calculation.

The AiiDAlab widgets help with these common tasks.
